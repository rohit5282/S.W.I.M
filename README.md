# S.W.I.M (SEQUENTIAL WAVE IMPRINTING MACHINES )
The SWIM device is a novel integration of audio signal processing, LED visualization, and mechanical motion control. By capturing audio data and mapping it to light intensity on an RGB LED strip, the machine aims to translate sound into a dynamic and visually engaging format. This project builds on the principle of audio waveform visualization, bringing it into a three-dimensional space through a combination of light and motion.
The S.W.I.M (Sequential Wave Imprinting Machines) project integrates several key hardware components to capture, process, and display audio signals in a dynamic, multi-sensory format. At the input stage, a mic/preamp board captures environmental audio, boosting the signal for processing, while a 3.5mm plug to RCA cable provides an alternative for capturing stereo audio from external sources. The central processing unit, a Raspberry Pi RP2040-Zero board, acts as the project's brain, handling real-time audio signal processing, controlling the RGB LED strip, and managing the stepper motor for motion control. The high-density RGB LED strip, featuring 144 LEDs per meter, serves as the primary visual output, mapping waveform amplitude to color and brightness, enabling high-fidelity visualization of sound. Additionally, a stepper motor, powered by a driver board, adds motion control, rotating or moving surfaces to create a spatial representation of the waveform, enhancing the visual experience by presenting sound waves across both time and space.
